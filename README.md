## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Assumptions

- **Simulated Downloads:**  
  - "Downloading" a PDF means adding it to an in-app list. PDFs are not actually copied to device storage.
  - All PDFs must be present in the `assets/pdfs/` folder.

- **Persistence:**  
  - The list of downloaded PDFs is stored in memory only. It resets when the app restarts.

- **PDF Viewing:**  
  - Opening a PDF uses the device's default PDF viewer or browser via `url_launcher`.

- **No Real File System Management:**  
  - PDFs are not saved to or deleted from the device's file system‚Äîonly managed within the app.

## üìù Assumptions

- The app is intended for demonstration or offline use with bundled assets.
- Users have a compatible PDF viewer installed on their device.
